            <p>Deb: <br> It would be cool if it was integrated with my calendar so it knows what I have in a day and adjusts my wake up time and schedule for the day accordingly.</p>
            <p>Dee: <br> I like it. I hate hitting snooze and sometimes I cancel the alarm without knowing it and sleep through and miss things so this will be really helpful.</p>
            <p>Minase: <br> Oh i like this
                And it will be very helpful to people that get morning madness
                But it also can be bad if the person isn’t living alone.</p>
            <p>Lera: <br> I love that it learns sleep patterns over time. Excited to try it and see how much better my mornings can be!</p>
            <p>Jaden: <br>  Cool addition could be a smart alarm that wakes users up at the best time in their sleep cycle (when they’re in a lighter stage), preventing grogginess.
                Overall, it’s a strong concept, but the key will be how well the AI can analyze and provide useful insights without just repeating what other apps already do. Would love to hear how you plan to refine it!
                Maybe we could have a “latest wakeup” option that way people don’t end up missing their responsibilities.
                </p>
            <p>Andrea: <br> You should use apple watches to track sleep data better. I think it’d be easier to gather more data if you did that.</p>
